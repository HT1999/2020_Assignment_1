# 2020_Assignment1
CSCI 2020U assignment 1

To run the programs, I would download the question files (Q1, Q2, etc) and
open them in IntelliJ IDE. Everything is already built according to IntelliJ
system. The image folder for Q1 was assumed to be in the src file (image/cards/...).

For Q4, I provided two random text files in the source file directory. Simply 
inputting the name of the file into the textfield will yield results.
